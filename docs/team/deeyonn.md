### Project: InternConnect

InternConnect is a one-stop, convenient, and efficient platform to manage and empower how internship campus recruiters who prefer CLI over GUI work with their applicantsâ€™ data. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
