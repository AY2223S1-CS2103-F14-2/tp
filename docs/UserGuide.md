--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.4 Specifiers:
Each field of an applicant is specified by a specifier as follows:
* `n/NAME`
* `p/PHONE`
* `e/EMAIL`
* `a/ADDRESS`
* `c/CAP`
* `g/GENDER`
* `u/UNIVERSITY`
* `gd/GRADUATION_DATE`
* `m/MAJOR`
* `ji/JOB_ID`
* `jt/JOB_TITLE`
* `t/TAG`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* An address book cannot have multiple persons with the exact same identity fields (`EMAIL`, and `JOB_ID`)
  e.g., `n/John e/j@example.com ji/J12332` and `n/Jason e/j@example.com ji/J12332` is considered the same applicant.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameter details to be supplied by the user.  
  e.g., in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Bobby Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/KIV`, `t/KIV t/offered` etc.

* Items in curly brackets are mandatory.
  e.g., `{mandatory_field_parameter/FIELD_DETAIL}`, all fields must be listed.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g., `n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bobby p/91234567 e/bob@example.com t/KIV` or as `n/Bobby p/91234567 e/bob@example.com`

* Parameters can be in any order, and are separated by a space.
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL`, `n/NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken. 
  e.g. if you specify p/12341234 p/56785678, only p/56785678 will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.  
  e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* All leading and trailing whitespaces will be trimmed, while multiple whitespaces in between words will be replaced by a single whitespace.

* All duplicate checks and find command keywords are case insensitive.
  e.g., `JACOB@example.com` will be considered equal to `jacob@EXAMPLE.COM`.
